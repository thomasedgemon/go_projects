password manager:

make program stateless

give user the option to only have to input master password once upon launch, or with every read/write action. 
  which is more secure?

read from / write to a csv so that the program can be stateless.

fields for new credential:
item name
username
password
notes. allow this to be null

how to save to csv? combine all three fields into one string with separated by commas, and then encrypt? store as item name, encryption in csv? 

how can we make the csv tamper evident? or at best, tamper proof?

will have to read in the item names from the csv in order to choose which to decrypt.
